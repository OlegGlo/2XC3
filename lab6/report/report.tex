\maketitle

This report includes the main observations that we found in this week's lab, along with the analysis of our results.

\newpage 
\section{Timing Data}
In this section, we analyze the test results of three functions and give our best judgement of how each of these functions is growing in $n$.
\subsection{\(f(n)\)}
For the data set of $f(n)$, the trend line appears to be linear. From the chart below we can see that the $R^2$ is 0.9992 for the linear equation. It is already a very good result.
